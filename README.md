# Pyramid-Scheme

A program that simulates a pyramid-scheme (similar to a tree data structure). Given a file containing information about 
how to add a member to the topology, a Network class is initialized based on the member's name and their asset, and finds the optimal
arrest scenario given a maximum amount of people to arrest, and a toplogy file. This was completed as an assignment in
July 2016, for csc148 (introduction to computer science) at the University of Toronto, St. George campus. A mark of 100% was recieved on this assignment, and was completed autonomously. 

More information on the assignment is posted here:
